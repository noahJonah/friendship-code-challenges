# Friendship Code Challenges

Welcome to **Friendship Code Challenges** a collection of fun, practical, and creative coding projects, friendly challenges from and my fellow devs.

This repository is all about **learning through collaboration**, **growing through experimentation**, and pushing ourselves to solve real-world problems across a variety of domains from web development and API integrations to Python scripting, Java building, mobile apps, and cybersecurity.

---

## Projects

Each challenge is stored as a standalone project with its own `README.md` containing:

-  A description of the problem  
-  The approach or solution  
-  How to run or test it  
-  Lessons learned  

**Naming convention:**  
`app-name-from-friend-name`  
Like: `weather-api-from-lisa` or `quiz-app-from-jay`.  
Keeping things personal and memorable.
